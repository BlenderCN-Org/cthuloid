# cthuloid

Cthuloid is an experimental autonomous theater umbrella project by Circus Automatic.

build a theater system that integrates robotics and performance into a hackable physical space where the performer can dictate lighting design to follow their every movement. Future plans include sound integration, shape changing scenery and more.

Inspired largely by video game level design, it will use blender and other programs for its internal representation. low cost electronics / sensors will be crafted for its real world implementation. a big goal is to form the feedback loop which will allow for more dynamic performance possibilities.
